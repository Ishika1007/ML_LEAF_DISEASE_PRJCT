## Abstract
The primary purpose of the project is to identify whether a particular cotton leaf is diseased or not and if it is diseased, identification of the disease is done. We have considered three main diseases - Alternaria Macrospora, Bacterial Blight and Grey Mildew.
The training data are images taken from web which are uploaded by ordinary humans. Assuming that the images are taken in uncontrolled environment, many difficulties are faced, making the machine- learning algorithm less effective. We have used Multi SVM classification Algorithm.
